# Lookas
Project name reason:
"Lookas" = **Look** at the codebase + "Lucas" (name of our manager)

### Problem in Detail

- **Steep Learning Curve:** Junior developers, interns, and new team members face overwhelming complexity when trying to understand existing codebases, often spending weeks just figuring out basic architecture and data flow.
- **Outdated/Missing Documentation:** Traditional documentation becomes stale quickly, doesn't reflect current code state, and lacks contextual connections between different parts of the system.
- **Knowledge Silos:** Critical architectural knowledge exists only in senior developers' heads, creating bottlenecks for onboarding and feature development.
- **Inefficient Code Discovery:** Developers waste time searching through files, trying to understand relationships between components, services, and data models without clear guidance.

### Solution

**Lookas** is an AI-powered codebase documentation platform that automatically generates, maintains, and visualizes living documentation that evolves with your code.

#### **Core Features**

- **Auto-Generated Living Documentation:**  
  AI analyzes commits/PRs to automatically update comprehensive documentation that stays current with code changes.

- **Android-Style Hierarchical Naming:**  
  Documents organized with dot-notation IDs (e.g., `backend.database`, `backend.database.migrations`, `frontend.components.auth`) enabling precise organization without naming conflicts.

- **Intelligent Linking & Cross-References:**  
  AI identifies and creates automatic links between related components, functions, and concepts across the codebase.

- **Interactive Codebase Graph:**  
  Visual dependency mapping showing how different parts of the system connect - from high-level architecture down to function-level relationships.

- **Smart Onboarding Paths:**  
  AI generates personalized learning paths for new developers based on their role, experience level, and the specific areas they need to work on.

- **Contextual Code Explanations:**  
  Natural language explanations of complex logic, design patterns, and architectural decisions with examples and use cases.

- **Real-Time Updates:**  
  Documentation automatically updates on commits/PRs, highlighting what changed and why it matters for the overall system.

#### **Advanced Features**

- **Code Impact Analysis:**  
  When viewing any component, see what depends on it and what it depends on, helping developers understand the ripple effects of changes.

- **Learning Progress Tracking:**  
  Track which parts of the codebase team members have explored and understood, identifying knowledge gaps.

- **AI-Powered Search:**  
  Natural language queries like "How does user authentication work?" or "Show me all database migration patterns" return relevant documentation and code examples.

- **Integration Tutorials:**  
  Auto-generated step-by-step guides for common development tasks like adding new API endpoints, database changes, or UI components.

### AI Prompt Architecture

#### **Primary Documentation Generation Prompt**
```
You are an expert software architect and technical writer. Analyze the provided code changes and generate comprehensive, beginner-friendly documentation.

CONTEXT:
- Repository: {repo_name}
- Changed files: {file_list}
- Commit message: {commit_message}
- Previous documentation: {existing_docs}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Generate documentation using hierarchical ID: {document_id}
2. Explain code purpose, patterns, and architectural decisions
3. Include practical examples and common use cases
4. Identify dependencies and relationships to other components
5. Use clear, jargon-free language suitable for junior developers
6. Highlight potential gotchas or important implementation details

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Title: Brief, descriptive heading
- Overview: 2-3 sentence summary
- Implementation Details: Step-by-step breakdown
- Dependencies: List related components with explanations
- Examples: Practical code usage examples
- Notes: Important considerations, edge cases, or tips

Focus on helping developers understand both the "what" and "why" of the code.
```

#### **Cross-Reference Detection Prompt**
```
Analyze the documentation for {document_id} and identify all logical connections to other parts of the codebase.

EXISTING DOCUMENTS: {document_catalog}

For each connection found:
1. Target document ID
2. Relationship type (depends-on, uses, extends, implements, etc.)
3. Brief explanation of the relationship
4. Confidence level (1-10)

Only suggest connections with high confidence (7+) to avoid noise.
```

#### **Onboarding Path Generation Prompt**
```
Create a personalized learning path for a {role} with {experience_level} experience who needs to work on {focus_areas}.

AVAILABLE DOCUMENTATION: {document_tree}
CODEBASE COMPLEXITY: {complexity_metrics}

Generate a progressive learning sequence:
1. Foundation concepts (start here)
2. Core workflows and patterns
3. Advanced topics and edge cases
4. Hands-on exercises or exploration tasks

Each step should build on previous knowledge and include estimated time investment.
```

### Architecture Improvements & Suggestions

#### **Smart Caching Strategy**
- Cache AI-generated documentation with invalidation based on file change detection
- Use content-addressed storage for code snippets to avoid regenerating identical explanations
- Implement incremental updates rather than full re-processing

#### **Multi-Language Support**
- Extend beyond typical web stack to support Python, Java, Go, Rust, etc.
- Language-specific documentation templates and best practices
- Framework-aware analysis (React patterns, Django conventions, etc.)

#### **Team Collaboration Features**
- Annotation system for developers to add context or corrections to AI-generated docs
- Discussion threads on specific documentation sections
- Knowledge validation workflow where senior devs can approve/edit AI suggestions

#### **Integration Ecosystem**
- VS Code extension for inline documentation viewing
- Slack/Discord bot for quick codebase Q&A
- Jira/Linear integration for linking tickets to relevant documentation

#### **Analytics & Insights**
- Track which documentation is most accessed/useful
- Identify knowledge gaps across the team
- Measure onboarding effectiveness and time-to-productivity

#### **Advanced Graph Features**
- Filter graph by technology stack, feature area, or developer
- Time-based visualization showing how architecture evolved
