# Lookas
## Codebase Knowledge Platform

<small>Turning sprawling repositories into crystal-clear documentation & insight.</small>

---

## Why Lookas?

**The problem**
- On-boarding a new developer often takes **weeks**.
- Tribal knowledge lives in heads & random wiki pages.

**Our goal**
> *Instantly illuminate any repository so new hires (and veterans) understand **what** exists and **why** it matters.*

---

## Core Use-Cases

1. **New-hire onboarding** – read AI-generated docs instead of spelunking the tree.
2. **LLM Context** – provide context to LLMs to help them understand the codebase.

---

## How does it work?

1. Reads code from GitHub.
2. Groups code by concepts, not by file. *(functions, classes, components, ...)*
3. Generates docs, taking the concepts into account.

---

## Future Roadmap

- Support for more languages (Java, Go, Rust).
- Embedding search over docs & code.
- Codebase graph visualisation.
- Re-scanning when something changes.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Minutes, not weeks** to understand any codebase.
- **Context-aware** – understand relationships between components, not just isolated files.
- **Built with familiar tools** – Next.js, Supabase, Mistral.

> *Lookas turns "Where do I start?" into "Let's ship."*
